            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p class="lead"><strong>The Illiterati of Denver</strong> is a social book club for awesome people.  We meet monthly to discuss our current book, reveal our next book selection, and generally hang out and be awesome.</p>

            <p>Currently, meetings are the first Monday of the month and typically take place in-or-around Denver's Highlands neighborhood, either at comfy businesses or at our members' homes.  We rotate which member picks the next book, and have read across many genres of fiction and non-fiction.</p>

            <p>Joining is easy. Just show up. That's it. If you've read <strong>the</strong> book, or read <em>a</em> book, even better!</p>

            <p>To stay informed as to what we are reading, and when and where our meetings are, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/denverilliterati" target="_blank">subscribe to our newsletter</a>!</p>

              <h4>Summary:</h4>
              <p>When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring act∨ JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity. Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he'll not only be unable to overcome--but that will define his life forever.</p>
