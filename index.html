            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p class="lead"><strong>The Illiterati of Denver</strong> is a social book club for awesome people.  We meet monthly to discuss our current book, reveal our next book selection, and generally hang out and be awesome.</p>

            <p>Currently, meetings are the first Monday of the month and typically take place in-or-around Denver's Highlands neighborhood, either at comfy businesses or at our members' homes.  We rotate which member picks the next book, and have read across many genres of fiction and non-fiction.</p>

            <p>Joining is easy. Just show up. That's it. If you've read <strong>the</strong> book, or read <em>a</em> book, even better!</p>

            <p>To stay informed as to what we are reading, and when and where our meetings are, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/denverilliterati" target="_blank">subscribe to our newsletter</a>!</p>

              <h4>Summary:</h4>
              <p>The Psychopath Test is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath.</p>

              <p>Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.</p>
